/**
 * Contains dynamic route functions for navigation.
 *
 * Purpose:
 * - Define functions to construct dynamic URLs for navigation based on parameters (e.g., user `id`).
 * - Provide a reusable way to navigate between routes in the app without hardcoding URLs.
 *
 * How to use:
 * - Import `navigateRoutes` in components that require dynamic navigation (e.g., navigating to user profiles, tasks, etc.).
 * - Call these functions with the required parameters (like `id`) to navigate.
